        "passageText": "Bukit Bangkirai, located in East Kalimantan, is a natural tourism park renowned for its tropical rainforest conservation. The park's primary allure is its Canopy Bridge, a 64-meter long wooden bridge suspended 30 meters above the forest floor. This bridge connects five massive Bangkirai trees, offering visitors a breathtaking \"Walking in the Sky\" experience, allowing them to observe the forest's rich biodiversity from above.\n\nThe park serves not only as a tourist destination but also as an important site for environmental education and research. Many visitors, including students and researchers, come to study the diverse flora and fauna. The decision to preserve this area rather than convert it to plantation land highlights a growing commitment to conservation, ensuring that this natural wonder can be enjoyed by future generations.",
